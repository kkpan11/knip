A long report can be frustrating. The list may contain false positives, but also
tons of useful information. To get the most value out of Knip, it may require
some initial configuration.

This guide helps you deal with false positives to find solutions and create the
perfect report, with minimal configuration that will keep your project tidy.

If you start out using Knip in a large project and have a long report, it makes
sense to go over the issue types one by one. For instance, reducing the number
of unused files will also reduce the number of unused dependencies.

1. [Unused files][1]
2. [Unused dependencies][2]
3. [Unresolved imports][3]
4. [Unused exports][4]

## Unused files

Getting the list of unused files right trickles down into the other issue types
as well, so we start here. Files are reported as unused if they are in the set
of `project` files, but not in the set of files resolved from the `entry` files:

```
unused files = project files - (entry files + resolved files)
```

Let's go over common causes for having to add `entry` patterns manually:

- [Dynamic import specifiers][5]
- [Unsupported arguments in scripts][6]
- [Unsupported file formats][7]
- [Missing plugin][8]
- [Incomplete plugin][9]
- [Integrated monorepos][10]
- [Build artifacts and ignored files][11]
- [Auto-mocking or auto-imports][12]

Use `--files` to [filter the report][13] and focus only on unused files:

```sh
knip --files
```

This works with other issue types as well. For instance, use `--dependencies` to
focus only on dependencies and exclude issues related to unused files and
exports.

:::caution

Don't add unused files to the `ignore` option before reading [configuring
project files][14]. Learn why and when to use `entry`, `project` and `ignore`
patterns for better results and performance.

:::

### Dynamic import specifiers

Dynamic import specifiers aren't resolved, such as:

```ts
const entry = await import(path.join(baseDir, 'entry.ts'));
```

Solution: add `entry.ts` to `entry` patterns.

### Unsupported arguments in scripts

Some tooling command arguments aren't recognized:

```json
{
  "name": "my-lib",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "unknown-build-cli --entry production.ts"
  }
}
```

**Solution**: add `production.ts` to `entry` patterns.

This works the same for any script, also those in GitHub Actions workflows or
Git hooks. See [script parser][15] for more details about Knip's script parser.

### Unsupported file formats

Entry files referenced in HTML files (e.g. `<script src="production.js">`).

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module" src="production.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Solution**: add `production.js` to `entry` patterns. Or add an `.html`
compiler to extract and resolve the value of `<script src>` elements.

Knip has support for some popular framework formats through [compilers][16], and
additional compilers can be added for for any file type. The recommended
solution is usually to add the file as shown in each example as an `entry` file.

### Missing plugin

You might be using a tool or framework for which Knip doesn't have a plugin
(yet). Configuration and entry files (and related dependencies) may be reported
as unused because there is no plugin yet that would include those files. Two
examples:

- Configuration file `tool.config.js` contains a reference to the package
  `"@tool/plugin"` → both the file and the dependency are reported as unused.
- A framework automatically imports all files matching `src/models/*.ts` → those
  files are reported as unused.

**Solution**: [create a new plugin][17] for the tool or framework that's not [in
the list][18] yet. Or work around it and add `entry` patterns and maybe ignore a
dependency or two (using [`ignoreDependencies`][19]).

### Incomplete plugin

Files may be reported as unused if existing plugins do not include that entry
file pattern yet. See the [plugins section of entry files][20] for more details.

**Solution**: [override plugin configuration][21] to customize default patterns
for existing plugins. Or even better: send a pull request to improve the plugin.

### Integrated monorepos

Multiple instances of configuration files like `.eslintrc` and
`jest.config.json` across the repository may be reported as unused when working
in a (mono)repo with a single `package.json`.

**Solution**: see [integrated monorepos][22] for more details and how to
configure plugins to target those configuration files.

### Build artifacts and ignored files

In rare cases, build artifacts and `.gitignore` files may have a surprising
effects on files reported as unused. Results may be different in separate runs,
depending on the presence of build artifacts.

**Solution**: Knip tries to do the right thing, but in some cases you may need
to add a file to the `entry` file patterns manually for better or more
consistent results.

### Auto-mocking or auto-imports

Some frameworks have features like "auto-mocking" or "auto-imports" enabled,
such as Jest and Nuxt.

**Solution**: include such entry files by extending the `entry` file patterns.
This is recommended in most cases:

```json
{
  "entry": ["src/index.ts", "src/models/*.ts"]
}
```

Alternatively, exceptions and outliers can be excluded from the analysis using
negated `project` patterns:

```json
{
  "project": ["src/**/*.ts", "!**/__mocks__/**"]
}
```

## Unused dependencies

Dependencies imported in unused files are reported as unused dependencies.
That's why it's strongly recommended to try and remedy [unused files][1] first.
Better `entry` and `project` file coverage will solve many cases of reported
unused dependencies.

The most common causes for unused dependencies include:

- [Missing or incomplete plugins][23]
- [Unrecognized references][24]
- [Type Definition Packages][25]

Use `--dependencies` to [filter the report][13] and focus only on issues related
to dependencies:

```sh
knip --dependencies
```

:::caution[Monorepo]

In a monorepo, a dependency is unused in the root workspace's `package.json` if
it's also listed in an descendent workspace, and referenced only in the
descendent workspace.

:::

### Missing or incomplete plugin

If a plugin exists and the dependency is referenced in the configuration file,
but its custom dependency finder does not detect it, then that's a false
positive. Please open a pull request or issue to fix it.

**Solution**: adding the configuration file as an `entry` file pattern may be a
temporary stopgap that fixes your situation, but it's better to create a new
plugin or fix an existing one.

### Unrecognized reference

Sometimes a reference to a dependency is unrecognizable or unreachable to Knip,
so it's a false positive and incorrectly reported as unused.

**Solution**: add a new plugin or improve an existing one. If you don't feel
like a plugin could solve it, a last resort is to use [ignoreDependencies][19].

If a binary (or "executable") is referenced you'll want to use `ignoreBinaries`
instead. See [unlisted binaries][26].

### Type Definition Packages

#### Bundled types

Many packages come with their type definitions bundled. This means the
`package.json#types` field in the package points to an internal/local type
definition file. In this case, the separate types package is obsolete.

Knip reporting this is also useful for future regressions: if a package had a
DefinitelyTyped or similar package for its types before and later on starts
shipping those types bundled with the source code, Knip will report the obsolete
types dependency as unused.

Examples include ESLint, Webpack and React Router, rendering the
`@types/eslint`, `@types/webpack` and `@types/react-router` dependencies
obsolete respectively.

**Solution**: remove the types dependency (often `@types/...`)

#### Production types

Knip is strict in the divide between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`. Some
packages are published with one or more type packages listed in `dependencies`.
In strict production mode, even when re-exported and part of the package's
public API, Knip does not try to figure out what exactly are "production types"
and expects those in `devDependencies`.

**Solution**: list exceptions in [ignoreDependencies][19].

### Unlisted dependencies

This means that a dependency is referenced directly in source code or
configuration, but not listed in `package.json`.

An unlisted dependency is usually a transitive dependency that's imported or
referenced directly. The dependency is installed (since it's a dependency of
another dependency) and lives in `node_modules`, but it's not listed explicitly
in `package.json`.

You should not rely on transitive dependencies for various reasons, including
control, security and stability.

**Solution**: install and list the dependency in `dependencies` or
`devDependencies`.

### Unlisted binaries

Binaries are executable Node.js scripts. Some npm packages, when installed, add
one or more executable files to use from scripts in `package.json`. Examples
include TypeScript that comes with the `tsc` binary, ESLint comes with `eslint`,
Next.js with `next`, and so on.

Knip detects such binaries in scripts and checks whether there's a package
installed that includes that binary. It looks up the `bin` field in the
`package.json` file of installed packages. If it doesn't find it, it will be
reported as an unlisted binary as there is no package listed that contains it.

Binaries that are installed on the OS already and not thus likely not meant to
be installed from npm are not reported as unlisted (details: [list of ignored
binaries in source][27]).

### Missing binaries

In case unused (dev) dependencies look like a match against unlisted binaries,
then this might be caused by `node_modules` not containing the packages. And
this might have been caused by either the way your package manager installs
dependencies and binaries, or by not running Knip from the root of the
repository.

**Solution**: run Knip from the project root. From there you can [lint
individual workspaces][28].

Sometimes binaries and how they're reported can be a bit confusing. See this
example:

```json
{
  "name": "lib",
  "scripts": {
    "commitlint": "commitlint --edit"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@commitlint/cli": "*"
  }
}
```

This example works fine without anything reported, as the `@commitlint/cli`
package includes the `commitlint` binary. However, some script may contain
`npx commitlint` and here Knip assumes `commitlint` is the name of the package.
This technically works, as `commitlint` is a transitive dependency of
`@commitlint/cli`. However, correct and recommeded usage is by the package name:
`npx @commitlint/cli`.

## Unresolved imports

Knip may be unable to resolve an import specifier or dependency reference.

The most common causes for unresolved imports:

- [Extensionless imports][24]
- [Unrecognized path aliases][29]
- [External aliased imports][30]

### Extensionless imports

Knip does not support extensionless imports for some non-standard extensions,
such as for `.svg` files. Bundlers like Webpack may support this, but Knip does
not. Here's an example:

```ts title="App.vue"
import Component from './Component'; // → Should resolve to ./Component.vue
import ArrowIcon from '../icons/Arrow'; // → Does NOT resolve to ../icons/Arrow.svg
```

The first import is resolved properly, because `.vue` is a known extension if
the Vue plugin is enabled. The second import might not be resolved, because
`.svg` is not a known extension.

The recommendation is to always add the extension when importing such files,
similar to how standard ES Modules specifies file extensions are necessary.

### Unrecognized path aliases

Knip considers TSconfig path aliases and [paths configured in knip.json][31],
but not those in e.g. Webpack or Vite configurations.

**Solution**: configure [paths][31] or try relative imports. Otherwise, use
[`ignoreUnresolved`][32] as a last resort.

### External aliased imports

External libraries may use aliased imports that aren't resolved by Knip.

For instance, [unplugin-icons][9] does this to import icons from icon sets as
components. Such imports are reported as unused. Use the [`paths` configuration
option][10] to tell Knip where to find the icon types:

```json title="knip.json"
{
  "paths": {
    "~icons/*": ["node_modules/unplugin-icons/types/[framework].d.ts"]
  }
}
```

Where `[framework]` is the name of the framework you're using (see [available
types][11]).

**Solution**: try [--include-libs][33] or configure [paths][31].

## Unused exports

By default, Knip does not report unused exports of `entry` files.

The most common causes for unused exports include:

- [Namespace enumerations][34]
- [External libraries][33]

Use the `--exports` flag to [filter][13] and focus only on issues related to
exports:

```sh
knip --exports
```

Use [includeEntryExports][35] to report unused exports of entry files as well.
This can be set per workspace.

### Namespace enumerations

For exports on an imported namespace, Knip considers all exports referenced if
that namespace is used in certain patterns like enumeration. Individual exports
are then **not** reported.

**Solution**: if all exports on imported namespaces should be considered
individually, include the `nsExports` issue type to disable the heuristic.

See [namepace imports][36] to see all related patterns.

### External libraries

Are the exports consumed or imported by an external library, resulting in a
non-standard consumption of your exports? Here's an example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="index.js">

    ```ts
    import loadable from '@loadable/component';

    export const DynamicApple = dynamic(() =>
      import('./components.js').then(mod => mod.Apple)
    );

    export const LoadableOrange = loadable(() => import('./components.js'), {
      resolveComponent: components => components.Orange,
    });
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="components.js">

    ```ts
    export const Apple = () => 'Apple';
    export const Orange = () => 'Orange';
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Knip understands `Apple` is used, since it's standard usage. But `Orange` is
referenced through a function of an external library. For performance reasons,
Knip does not include external type definitions by default so it won't see the
export being referenced.

**Solution**: include the type definitions of external libraries with the
[--include-libs][37] flag:

```shell
knip --include-libs
```

This comes at a performance and memory penalty, but should give better results
if you need it. This flag is implied when [classMembers][38] are included (that
feature comes with roughly the same performance penalty).

### Exclude exports from the report

To exclude false positives from the report, there are a few options:

- [Ignore exports used in file][39] for exports used internally.
- Individual exports can be [tagged using JSDoc syntax][40].
- Have the export in an entry file:
  - Add the file to the `entry` file patterns array in the configuration.
  - Move the export(s) to an entry file.
  - Add the file to the `exports` field of `package.json`
- Re-export the unused export(s) from an entry file.

### Missing unused exports?

Did you expect certain exports in the report, but are they missing? They might
be exported from an entry file. In that case, use [--include-entry-exports][35]
to make Knip also report unused exports in entry files.

The exports of non-standard extensions like `.astro`, `.mdx`, `.vue` or
`.svelte` are not available by default. See [compilers][16] for more details on
how to include them.

### Class members

Unused members of exported classes are not reported by default, here's how to
enable them:

```sh
knip --include classMembers
```

This option is also available in the Knip configuration file. Note that this
feature comes at a cost: linting will take more time and more memory.

Individual class members can be [tagged using JSDoc syntax][40].

Classes exported from entry files are ignored, and so are their members. Use
[--include-entry-exports][35] to make Knip also report members of unused exports
in entry files.

### Enum members

Unused enums and unused members of exported enums are reported by default.
Reporting such members can be disabled:

```sh
knip --exclude enumMembers
```

Individual enum members can be [tagged using JSDoc syntax][40].

Enums exported from entry files are ignored, and so are their members. Use
[--include-entry-exports][35] to make Knip also report members of unused exports
in entry files.

## Feedback or false positives?

If you believe Knip incorrectly reports something as unused (i.e. there's a
false positive), feel free to create a [minimal reproduction][41] and open an
issue on GitHub. It'll make Knip better for everyone! Join the [Discord
